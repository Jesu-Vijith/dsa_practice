Huffman Coding:
    ->  It is a lossless algorithm for data compression (No data loss)

    STEPS:
        -> Pass the main String that needs to be compressed (data,aka feeder)
        -> Make frequency map on it
        -> For every key in the frequency map, create a node and insert that node in a min heap/priority queue
        -> Node data: char data;int cost-> frequency;Node left;Node right
        -> Remove 2 elements from heap and combine
        ->
